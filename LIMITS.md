# Limits

What this does not do, why, and what would change it. Written down because
the failure this project is named after is a system that is confidently
wrong and quiet about it, and being that system while complaining about it
would be a poor look.

Nothing here is a to-do list. Some of these are permanent, some are
decisions waiting for evidence, and a few are bugs that have not happened
yet. They are marked.

## 1. The one that actually matters

**Nobody has used this but its author.** 83 commits, one contributor, zero
external users, zero pilots. Every claim in this repository is verified by
somebody who also wrote the claim.

That is not a coverage problem and no amount of code fixes it. The suite is
good at holding claims somebody thought to state; it has never once been the
thing that caught a problem a *user* hit, because there have been no users.
Three defects this month were found by running something new rather than by
a test catching a regression — which is the honest description of where the
value of an outside perspective would land.

**What would change it:** one team, two weeks, their own corpus. Everything
else on this page is second.

## 2. What refusal structurally cannot do

These are properties of the idea, not gaps in the implementation. None of
them will be fixed; they should be designed around.

### It binds a read, not a value

Once a caller holds the fields, they are outside the boundary. A copy taken
before a mark was written is not the document — it is what the document
*used to say* — and the per-document check admits it, correctly, because it
refuses what it is **shown**.

This matters most where it is least expected. In a long-running agent, a
fact revoked at turn 40 does not vanish from the context the agent carried
forward itself. The remedy is not a cleverer boundary: re-read the carried
ids through the handle at the top of each turn. That context is a cache and
this is the cache invalidating.

### It binds this application, not your data

Another service with its own connection to the same cluster is unaffected.
This is the entire reason the wire boundary exists (it binds a *connection*
rather than an import) and the entire reason cryptographic erasure exists
beside it (a destroyed key is not bypassable by connecting somewhere else).

Neither fully closes it. A DBA with a shell still reads everything that is
not encrypted.

### Admission is a veto, not a constructor

It can refuse a document for what is already on the page. It cannot
**require** that something be on it. So a diversity *floor* — "this context
must include a dissenting source" — is not expressible as a refusal.

A floor is a retrieval objective and belongs to the ranker. A ceiling is an
admission rule and belongs here. Do not let anyone talk you into faking the
first with the second.

### A rule with no query half is invisible to static analysis

You can scan a repository for reads that forget a deadline filter. You
cannot scan it for a token budget, because the reads it refuses look
identical to the reads it admits. This is true of every static analyser, not
just a homegrown one — Semgrep and CodeQL have the same nothing to work
with.

### Partial enforcement is worse than none

Covering `deleteOne` and not `findOneAndDelete` does not give you half a
guarantee, it gives you a false one — which is the only kind that gets
trusted. This already happened once here and was caught by a probe that
tried every destructive verb rather than the one under test.

**Consider:** any new write path is a new instance of this. The question to
ask of each is not "does it work?" but "what else could make a fact
unreachable that I have not looked at?"

---

## 3. The wire boundary

It is correct before it is operable. Some of that is closed; the rest is
listed honestly.

### Closed

Aggregation stages that write elsewhere (`$out`, `$merge`).
TLS termination for clients (`--tls-cert`; without one it binds loopback
only, because a plaintext boundary on a network would carry in the clear
everything it just refused). TLS and SRV upstream, so it can front Atlas.
Primary discovery. Failover by reading the server's own
`NotWritablePrimary` rather than polling. Message size capped at MongoDB's
own 48MB ceiling. Bounded connections, closed rather than queued. A draining
`SIGTERM`.

**Clients cannot walk past it.** `--advertise-self` rewrites `hello` so clients stay on the boundary rather
than following the cluster's host list, which is what makes this
*enforcement* rather than a `directConnection=true` the caller has to
remember. Two fields are deliberately passed through untouched:
`isWritablePrimary` and `secondary`. Forcing them true would keep clients
pinned during a failover, which sounds like an improvement and is the
opposite — that flag is the signal a driver uses to notice its upstream is
no longer writable, and masking it means the client writes happily into an
outage. `setName` is kept for the same class of reason: strip it and drivers
treat the target as a standalone, which silently disables retryable writes.

### Open

**`--workers` orphans on `SIGKILL`.** Workers leave the parent's process
group so the parent is the only thing that signals them -- that is what
stops a terminal's `SIGINT` reaching a worker twice and killing it mid-drain
before it reports its counts. The cost is the other direction: `kill -9` on
the parent leaves the children accepting connections with nobody to drain
them. `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` are both handled and both drain cleanly, so
this needs somebody to reach for `-9` specifically. **Consider:** a
supervisor that reaps by process group will not find them.

**One node, no topology.** Clients are pinned here, but *here* is a single
process group: it does not load-balance reads, honour read preference, or retry a
write the client already saw fail. Pinning and fanning out are different
problems and only the first one is solved.

**A failover costs the in-flight requests.** Re-resolution happens on the
*next* connection. The request that received `NotWritablePrimary` is
returned to the client, which retries — correct, and worth knowing before
somebody reports it as a bug.

**No upstream pooling, deliberately.** A MongoDB connection carries
authentication, sessions, cursors and transactions; sharing one would hand a
cursor to whoever asked second. One upstream per client is the right shape;
what is bounded is how many exist. Connection count still scales 1:1 with
clients -- that part is permanent and correct.

What is no longer true is the cost of one. This used to be two OS threads
per connection, and this page used to say that past a few hundred it wanted
"an event loop or a different language." The second half was wrong: every
byte-rewriting function here is `bytes -> bytes` over a pure `reachable()`,
so nothing about the *boundary* was ever tied to the transport. Only the
shell was, and replacing it was a contained change rather than a rewrite.

Measured on this laptop, idle connections held open, old versus new:

| connections | threads | RSS | accept |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | 1,201 -> 19 | 87.6MB -> 50.7MB | 0.12s -> 0.03s |
| 1,500 | 4,501 -> 19 | 210.0MB -> 68.2MB | 0.85s -> 0.11s |
| 3,000 | 9,001 -> 19 | 364.5MB -> 92.0MB | 3.39s -> 0.25s |

The 19 is a fixed executor pool, not per connection; it does not grow.

**One event loop is still one core.** Under 24 concurrent clients a single
worker sits at **96.7% CPU** -- pinned to one core, because the per-message
cost here is BSON decode in `decode_sections` and `enforce` and no event
loop spreads that. `--workers N` pre-forks N processes over one inherited
listening socket, which is the knob that uses the other cores.

**Consider:** the measured gain from `--workers 4` was only **1.42x**
(635 -> 901 queries/sec), not 4x, because at that point `mongod` and the
load generator were competing for the same fourteen cores as the proxy. The
honest reading is that the *single-core ceiling is real and now removable*,
not that four workers buy four times the throughput. Nobody has run this on
a machine where the database is somewhere else, which is the only
measurement that would settle it.

**No metrics endpoint.** Counters exist and print on shutdown -- summed
across workers and printed once, because N workers each printing their own
summary reads exactly like the real thing while reporting a fraction of the
traffic. There is still no `/metrics`, no structured log, nothing to scrape.
**Consider:** this is the first thing anybody operating it will ask for, and
it is now the *only* thing on this list blocking a week-long pilot.

**`update` is not intercepted.** An `update` that overwrites a fact is
mutation, not forgetting, and treating it otherwise would make every edit a
revocation. That is the right call, but it means "make this unreachable" has
exactly two supported spellings and a third that silently does something
else.

**Aggregation `$out` / `$merge` — found here, verified, and closed.** These
write inside the server, so the documents never come back to the client and
the read path is never handed one to refuse. Measured: a connection that had
just declined to show a revoked document copied it into another collection
anyway. A proxy cannot make these safe, so they are refused with a reason,
the same answer `drop` gets. Ordinary aggregation is untouched.

**Consider:** that hole was invisible because it does not *look*
destructive. Any future server-side write stage is the same shape, and the
question to ask is not "is this a delete?" but "does the client ever see the
documents?"

## 4. Coverage

113 tests, ~2,210 lines, against 8,078 lines of `voyd/` and 1,497 of
`tools/`. Well-targeted rather than thorough: the coverage is by *claim*,
which is the right axis, but it is not line coverage and should not be
mistaken for it.

687 lines are mentioned by no test file. Most of that is defensible —
`composition.py` is type-checked rather than executed by design,
`trait.py` and `expiry.py` are small and exercised indirectly, `sealing.py`
runs under the encryption tests even though a name-scan cannot see it.
`capabilities.py` (130 lines) is the one with no real excuse.

**Consider:** the suite is fast by default (116 tests, ~19 seconds) with
real index builds and the live-Atlas tests deselected. `-m ""` includes
them and takes minutes, varying with cloud latency -- that variance is the
flag working, not a flake, and it is worth knowing before somebody reports
it as one. CI clears the deselection and a test pins those two
facts together — but that arrangement is exactly how a test quietly stops
being run, so check it is still true before trusting it.

---

## 5. Operational notes that will surprise somebody

**A search index is not free, and `mongot` is shared.** Nine abandoned
databases carrying 24 search indexes between them was enough to starve new
index builds and make a healthy test fail for a reason unrelated to
refusal. If index builds get slow, count your leftovers before debugging
anything else.

**Atlas Local registers no embedding models.** It *declines* an `auto_embed`
declaration and silently falls back to expecting a client-supplied vector.
Anything testing server-side embedding locally is testing the opposite of
what it claims.

**The embedding model list moves.** `voyage-3` was dropped; the server
reports the supported set in its own error, which is the most useful error
message in this stack.

**A collection must exist before you can index it.** Atlas answers "Error
retrieving collection UUID," which reads like a permissions problem.

**`.primary` is `None` on an undiscovered topology.** The driver connects
lazily. Ping first, or you silently select whichever node DNS returned —
which on a replica set reads perfectly and rejects every write.

---

## 6. Decisions waiting on evidence

Not frozen out of caution — frozen because building them before somebody
wants them adds surface that has to be kept honest forever.

| | what it would take | what would unfreeze it |
|---|---|---|
| **A metrics surface** | small | anybody running it for a week |
| **`$out` / `$merge` handling** | small, and it is a hole | do this one anyway |
| **Revocation that propagates** | a sync protocol | `perimeter.py` says who else holds a copy is auditable and never enforceable. That is true without a protocol between you and the replica — and stops being true with one |
| **Reverse-indexed receipts** | a storage decision | *"which answers were built on this fact?"* is already a query for anything written back; what is missing is the artefact that **left** — a Slack message, a fine-tune |
| **A second engine** | doubles the surface | a user who is not on MongoDB |
| **A second listener topology** | real work | `--workers` pins clients to one host; fanning out is still a different problem |

---

## 7. Deliberately not doing

Reasons recorded so they are not relitigated every six months.

- **A delete verb of our own.** A delete hands the caller a cleanup
  obligation, and an agent that has to remember to clean up is the failure
  this exists to remove. Asserted by a test that has now outlived three
  surfaces.
- **An undo for `revoke()`.** The row is already scheduled for the reaper,
  so the undo would work until `ttlMonitorSleepSecs` decided otherwise — an
  API whose window is a storage event, in a codebase written to argue that
  guarantees must not depend on sweepers. Re-admitting erased information is
  a new document with new provenance.
- **Pushing the deadline into the vector index.** A `vectorSearch`
  definition cannot be updated in place, so it is a drop-and-rebuild on
  every deployment, and a rebuilding index returns zero rows rather than
  erroring.
- **Ledgering reads.** A write per refused hit, for a property the read path
  enforces anyway.

## 8. If you read one thing

The recurring defect in this project is not a category of bug. It is a
**category of silence**: an instrument that is wrong and says nothing. The
decode that returned `None` and was read as "not a delete". The proxy that
answered `deleted_count=1` while really deleting. The scanner that blessed a
path it never read. The suite that passed because a closed socket counted as
alive.

Every one was found by running the thing at the size and in the manner the
documentation promised, and none by re-reading the documentation. That is
the method, and it transfers to whatever gets built next.
