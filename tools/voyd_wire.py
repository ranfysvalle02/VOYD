"""A MongoDB connection that cannot serve a fact you have forgotten.

    # terminal 1 -- rules in a file that is not your application

    # terminal 2 -- any driver, any language
    mongosh mongodb://localhost:27099/demo

Everything else in this repository binds a *handle*: `docs.find(...)` refuses
and `db.notes.find(...)` does not, which is why there is a raw-read guard, a
scanner, and a CI gate asserting no module reaches past the handle. All of
that is machinery for stopping your own team from doing the easy thing.

This moves the boundary to the wire. It speaks the MongoDB protocol, sits
between any client and any `mongod`, and applies the same per-document check
to every document on the way back. The guarantee then binds the *connection*,
so there is no raw read to guard -- not from Node, not from Compass, not from
a data scientist's notebook, not from a shell that has never heard of VOYD.

**It holds no database connection of its own.** `reachable()` is pure: it is
handed documents and returns the ones a prompt may see. So this process needs
no credentials beyond forwarding yours, and adds no round trip. That is the
same property that makes shadow mode three lines.

**What this is and is not.** It is a demonstration that the boundary is
portable, and it is deliberately outside `voyd/` -- nothing here is importable
package surface. It is not a production proxy: no TLS termination, no
connection pooling, no auth passthrough beyond what the client sends, one
thread per direction, and receipts shared across connections. A real one is a
different project and probably not written in Python. The point it makes is
architectural, and it makes it in about three hundred lines.

The wire framing -- header layout, OP_MSG sections, OP_COMPRESSED -- is lifted
from `tools/wire_proxy.py` in the author's `mdb-embedded` repository, MIT to
MIT. That file logs traffic; this one rewrites it.

    This is the half of the story the read path could not tell. A boundary

    the better meaning:

    writes -- the literal mark, the deadline moved *earlier only*, and the
    derived encodings nulled -- so a fact forgotten through the wire and one
